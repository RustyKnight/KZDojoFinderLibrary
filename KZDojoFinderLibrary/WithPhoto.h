 Okay, this is a little dubious in the naming...
 
 Basically, I had two class which could have pictures/photos, they
 basically had to work the same we, providing feedback via the consumer
 so I wanted to wrap them up in a protocol, but couldn't come up with a
 suitable name...Photoable? Picturable? Imageable?
